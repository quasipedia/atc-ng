The very basics
===============

This section provides the very essential information you need to play ATC-NG.

.. index:: Game objective

Objective
---------
In ATC-NG you play the role of an air traffic controller. Your job is to safely
guide aeroplanes to their destinations. In order to achieve your goal, you issue
commands to individual plane pilots.

Three things to keep in mind
----------------------------
#. You must maintain **separation between aircrafts**. That means that they each
   plane must be separated by the nearest one by either a ground distance of
   5000 metres or a vertical distance of 500 metres.
#. Aeroplanes have a **limited amount of fuel** onboard. Make sure to
   make them reach their destination before they run out of it and fall out the
   sky.
#. The **three strikes out** rule applies: after you let three aeroplanes to
   crash or to leave the aerospace not from a :term:`gate` the game will
   terminate.

How the game unfolds
--------------------
* The game starts with an empty aerospace.
* After a few seconds (just giving you the time to get acquainted with the
  scenario) the first aeroplane will appear on screen. All aeroplanes appear at
  either an aeroport (if they are on the ground) or at one of the *gates* on the
  edges of your radar screen (if they are airborne).
* At the same time, on your left hand side, you will see a *flight strip*
  appearing. You can find here where the plane is headed and how much fuel it
  has left onboard.
* You will then instruct the plane with the appropriate commands using the
  console on the bottom of your screen (pilots always confirm reception of the
  command and will inform you if for any reason they can't perform the required
  action)
* The ATC-NG game engine will gradually increase the rate at which new planes
  will enter your aerospace.
