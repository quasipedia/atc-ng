Landing
=======
Landing at airports is done with the help of **ILS (Instrument Landing
System)**. This means that once the aeroplane is cleared for landing, it will
try to intercept the gliding path for the foot of the runway.

There are a few things to consider when clearing an aeroplane for landing:

* The angle between the current heading of the aeroplane and the runway
  orientation must be less or equal than 60 degrees.

* The aeroplane will **first** try to align itself with the runway, and
  **then** it will adjust its altitude and speed.

* The gliding angle for an ILS is always the standard 3Â°.

* The speed of the aeroplane will be kept constant as long as possible, then it
  will be progressively reduced in order for the plane to touch down at its
  nominal landing speed. This behaviour makes easier to maintain separation
  between planes approaching the same runway.

* The runway will be busy (i.e. unavailable for other planes to land / take off
  for 30 seconds after touchdown.
