Leaving the aerospace
=====================

Aeroplanes can legally leave the aerospace only through :term:`gates<gate>`.

Failing to leave the aerospace from a gate will trigger a penality as described
in the :doc:`scoring section<scoring>` of the manual. Leaving the aerospace
from a different gate than the designated, will also trigger a penalty, although
not as severe.

**Gates are bi-directional** which means planes can both *enter* and *exit* the
aerospace. To avoid collisions, in ATC-NG, **eaven fligh levels (like 10, 20,
30) are reserved for leaving the aerospace**, while odd ones (like 05, 15, 25)
are reserved for entering it. Leaving the aerospace from the correct gate but
the wrong fligh level will count as leaving the aerospace at the wrong gate.
