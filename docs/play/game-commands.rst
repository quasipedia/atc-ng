Game commands
=============
Game commands are those commands that are issued to the game engine (as opposed
to aeroplanes). At present, the only useful implemented command is ``quit``
(to exit the game).

Game commands are issued in the console by prepending them with a ``/``. For
example:

>>> /quit
