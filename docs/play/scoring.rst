Scoring System

Rationale

The scoring system is based on the following chart:

.. _fuel:

Fuel
----
Beside the "burning one unit of fuel" and "triggering fuel emergency" events
above, fuel influences score when an aeroplane terminate its existence. In
particular an **amount o points equal to the amount of fuel still onboard**
at the moment in which the plane terminates is added or subtracted to the score
according to whether the end-of-life event was rewarded or penalised.

For example a plane crashing with 250 units of fuel will affect the overall
score by -1250 points, while a plane landing with 123 units of fuel will change
the score of +623 points.

Also note that during maneouvers performed with the ``expedite`` flag, fuel
consumption happens twice as fast.

For an accurate description of the fuel modelling in ATC-NG see the :doc:`fuel
explanation<fuel>` page.
