Configuration & Settings
========================
As already mentioned elsewhere in the manual, *NG* also stands for *"for \*nix
geeks"*, and in the best :term:`unix-like<\*nix>` tradition, ATC-NG gives the
player the possibility to alter certain settings via a configuration file,
located in the user's directory (on most GNU/Linux systems the file should be
found at ``~/.atc-ng/settings.yml``.

The file is in :term:`YAML` format, and it's heavily commented. Here's the
latest version (your version may very slightly, depending on the installed
release of the game):

.. include:: ../settings-file.inc
