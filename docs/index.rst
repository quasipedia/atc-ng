The ATC-NG game
===============
ATC-NG stands for **Air Traffic Controller - Next Generation** [*]_ and it is
a game inspired by the classic text-only *atc* game from the early 80's.
Currently the game is in **alpha state**: some of the final functionality is
already implemented, but not enough to play the game completely.

.. [*] An alternative explanation for the *NG* part of the game is *"for *Nix
       Geeks"*. This is a reference to the fact the game only offers a
       commandline interface for playing (this is by design and is unlikely
       to change in the future).
