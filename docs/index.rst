The ATC-NG game
===============
ATC-NG stands for **Air Traffic Controller - Next Generation** [*]_ and it is
a game inspired by the classic text-only *atc* game from the early 80's.
Currently the game is in **alpha state**: some of the final functionality is
already implemented, but not enough to play the game completely.

.. [*] An alternative explanation for the *NG* part of the game is "for
       :term:`\*nix` geeks". This is a reference to the fact the game only
       offers a commandline interface for playing (this is by design and is
       unlikely to change in the future).
