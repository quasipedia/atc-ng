Issues (bugs & ideas)
=====================

In computing, the term **issue** is a unit of work to accomplish an improvement
in a system. An issue could be a bug, a requested feature, task, missing
documentation, and so forth.

ATC-NG uses the `GitHub issue tracker`_ to keep track of its issues. If you
think you found a problem with ATC-NG or if you have an idea on how to improve
the game by adding a new functionality, modifying an existing one and so
forth... Please don't hesitate to file a new issue there we always welcome
ideas.

Filing a bug
------------

If you encounter a bug and chose to report it, please make sure to include **as
much information as possible to reproduce it**. Example of poor bug reporting:

    *"After a little time playing the game, ATC-NG crashes when I give commands
    to planes."*

A better way to report the same problem:

    *"On a standard scenario, if I instruct the two planes to land at the
    opposite ends of a runway (for example runways 18 and 36 of the Stockholm-
    Arlanda airport), the program will crash."*
