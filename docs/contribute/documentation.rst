Project documentation
=====================

We are putting a great effort in keeping the ATC-NG documentation relevant and
up-to-date, and we will welcome any helping hand to keep doing so.

If you found a problem with the documentation there are at least three ways you
could help fixing it:

Report an issue
---------------
A problem with documentation is an :doc:`issue<issues>`, and it's perfectly OK
to use the `GitHub issue tracker`_ to bring it to the developers' attention.

Fix it yourself
---------------
ATC-NG documentation is built automatically using :term:`reStructuredText`
source files, this is an easy-to-learn and intuitive :term:`markup language`
that make the source pages of the documentation to look very similar to how you
would probably write them in a text-only e-mail. See for yourself - for
example - the source of `this very same page`_.
