This section of the documentation provides information on how to contribute
to the ATC-NG project. You do not need to be a programmer to contribute, in fact
you can contribute by either, or either combination of the following:

.. index:: Git, GitHub

Git & GitHub
------------
The ATC-NG project is developed using Git_, and more specifically GitHub_. If
you plan to contribute to the project it would probably be a good idea to
familiarise yourself with those tools (although this is not strictly necessary).
Good starting points are:

- The official `git tutorial <http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html>`_
- The `github help section <http://help.github.com/>`_
