Get involved!
=============
This section of the documentation provides [*]_ information on how to contribute
to the ATC-NG project. You do not need to be a programmer to contribute, in fact
you can contribute by either, or either combination of the following:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   advertise
   issues
   documentation
   entities
   plugins
   translations

.. [*] This is just a stub, mainly to give a rought idea on what the possibility
       will be once the game will be released, at the moment the game code is
       still too unstable to be able to accept contributions.
