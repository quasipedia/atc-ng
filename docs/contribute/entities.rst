Entities
========
ATC-NG uses YAML to describe all its in-game entities.

YAML_ is a *human friendly data serialization standard*, and this means that is
very straightforward to create new entities or modify the existing ones.

.. _YAML: http://yaml.org/

The in-game *entities* that have already been implemented are:

- Airlines
- Aeroports
- Scenarios (including Beacons and Gates)

As soon as the development will reach a point where it will make sense to do so,
the *aeroplane models* will also be implemented.

You can have a preview of how the yaml files look like for each of the
implemented entities by browsing through the `appropriate folder`_ of the main
repo.

.. _`appropriate folder`: https://github.com/quasipedia/atc-ng/tree/master/entities/data

Please observe that there is yet no guarantee this is the final format for the
game. As soon as the format will be deemed stable for the 1.x series, this
page will be expanded with an explanation of each entity data.
