Plugins
=======

With the term *plugins* we refer to all those in-game elements whose difference
of behaviour is due to a difference way of processing the same data. We use
this term to mark a clear distinction with the :doc:`entities`.

This means that in order to contribute a new plugin to the game you need basic
programming skills in *python*, the programming language ATC-NG is developed
with.

At the moment ATC-NG doesn't have a plugin infrastructure in place yet, but
in the near future the way ATC-NG challenges the player will be plugin-based and
it will be possible to have different "game modes": for example beside the
standard one there might be a time-based one, or a two players, over-the-net
challenge mode...
