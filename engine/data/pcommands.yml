abort:
  spellings: [abort, purge]
  arguments: 0
  flags:
    lastonly: [lastonly, last, l]
  validator: null
  description: >
    An aeroplane that is maneuvering can't execute a new command until the
    maneuver is completed. The ``ABORT`` command makes a plane that is perfoming
    a command to stop its execution (mantaining heading, speed and altitude) and
    makes it available to receive new commands.

      Beside halting command execution, an ``ABORT`` command will also flush the
      command queue. The ``LASTONLY`` flag - on the other hand - allows to
      eliminate *only the last* command in the queue.
  examples: |

    >>> QFA1234 ABORT
    >>> DLH5678 PURGE LAST

altitude:
  spellings: [altitude, a, alt]
  arguments: 1
  flags:
    expedite: [expedite, x]
  validator: _validate_altitude
  description: >
    The ``ALTITUDE`` command alters the flying target altitude of an aeroplane.
    Altitude is expressed in hundreds of metres above sea level.

      The ``EXPEDITE`` flag doubles the speed at which an aeroplane climbs or
      descends.
  examples: |

    >>> QFA1234 ALTITUDE 55
    >>> DLH5678 ALTITUDE 80 X

circle:
  spellings: [circle, c, hold]
  arguments: 1
  flags: []
  validator: _validate_circle
  description: >
    The ``CIRCLE`` command will make an aeroplane to fly a circular pattern,
    basically holding position.

      The command takes a single argument which is the direction of the
      circling: clockwise (``CW``, ``RIGHT`` or ``R``) or counter-clockwise
      (``CCW``, ``LEFT`` or ``L``)
  examples: |

    >>> QFA1234 CIRCLE CCW
    >>> DLH5678 HOLD R

heading:
  spellings: [heading, h, head]
  arguments: 1
  flags:
    expedite: [expedite, x]
    long: [l, long]
  validator: _validate_heading
  description: >
    The ``HEADING`` command alter the target heading of an aeroplane. The
    argument of the command can either be a *new degree heading* (expressed as a
    three-digit figure or the code of a *beacon*, for which the most appropriate
    heading will be calculated.

      The ``EXPEDITE`` flag increses the banking angle of the aeroplane,
      effectively decreasing the time needed for the aeroplane to reach its
      target heading.

      The plane will always perform the turn in the direction that requires less
      time to complete (smaller angle). The ``LONG`` flag - on the other hand -
      allows to perform the turn in the opposite direction.
  examples: |

    >>> QFA1234 HEADING 080
    >>> DLH5678 H 150 X
    >>> QFA1234 HEAD 270 L X
    >>> DLH5678 HEADING NDB1 LONG EXPEDITE

land:
  spellings: [land, l, down]
  arguments: 2
  flags: []
  validator: _validate_land
  description: >
    The ``LAND`` command instruct the plane to intercept the descent flight path
    to the foot of a given runaway, and perform the landing.

      The command takes two arguments: the **IATA code of the aeroport** and
      the **runaway name**.
  examples: |

    >>> QFA1234 LAND FRA 07R
    >>> DLH5678 DOWN ARN 26

speed:
  spellings: [speed, s, sp]
  arguments: 1
  flags:
    expedite: [expedite, x]
  validator: _validate_speed
  description: >
    The ``SPEED`` command alter the target ground speed of an aeroplane. The
    target speed of the aeroplane is expressed in **kph**
    (kilometres per hour).

      The ``EXPEDITE`` flag increses the acceleration/deceleration, making the
      maneuver to execute faster.
  examples: |

    >>> QFA1234 SPEED 800
    >>> DLH5678 SP 450 EXPEDITE

takeoff:
  spellings: [takeoff, to, up, fly]
  arguments: 1
  flags:
    expedite: [expedite, x]
  validator: _validate_altitude
  description: >
    The ``TAKEOFF`` command instructs the plane to take off a given runaway.
    Once airborne, the plane will keep on climbing until its maximum flight
    altitude.

      The ``EXPEDITE`` flag increses the climbing rate, making the maneuver to
      execute faster.
  examples: |

    >>> QFA1234 TAKEOFF 04L
    >>> DLH5678 UP 01 X
