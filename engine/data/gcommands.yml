QUIT:
  spellings: [QUIT, EXIT]
  arguments: 0
  flags: []
  validator: null
  description: >
    Quit the program immediately (no further question asked).
  examples: |

    >>> /QUIT
    >>> /EXIT

PAUSE:
  spellings: [PAUSE, P]
  arguments: 0
  flags: []
  validator: null
  description: >
    Toggle between the game running normally e the game being paused. On some
    systems it's possible to achieve the same result by pressing the
    :kbd:`pause` key, if present.

      While the game is paused, the radar screen is obfuscated.
  examples: |

    >>> /PAUSE
    >>> /P

LIST:
  spellings: [LIST, LS]
  arguments: 1
  flags:
    DESCRIPTION: [DESCRIPTION, D]
  validator: _validate_list
  description: >
    List the available scenarios on the system.

      Without arguments, the command will list all the available scenarios, but
      it is possible to filter them using a :term:`glob<globbing>` as parameter.
      ATC-NG uses an extremely simplified form of globbing, for which the
      parameter will be surrounded by asterisks (see example below).

      Normally, pattern matching is performed on file names, but if the
      ``DESCRIPTION`` flag is used, the matching will be performed on the
      description of the scenario.

      +--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | ISSUED COMMAND     | LISTED SCENARIOS                                 |
      +====================+==================================================+
      | /LIST              | All currently available (all installed)          |
      +--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | /LIST SKY-OVER-    | All whose filename match the *SKY-OVER-* glob.   |
      +--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
      | /LS FUNNY D        | All that contain the word "funny" in their       |
      |                    | description.                                     |
      +--------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

      Patter matching is **case insensitive**.
  examples: |

    >>> /LIST SKY-OVER-
    >>> /LS FUNNY D

LOAD:
  spellings: [LOAD, LO]
  arguments: 1
  flags: []
  validator: _validate_load
  description: >
    Load a scenario (start a new game on that scenario).

      The parameter must be the name of a scenario currently installed on the
      system. Use the ``/LIST`` command for a list of installed scenarios.
  examples: |

    >>> /LOAD SKY-OVER-STOCKHOLM
    >>> /LO SKY-OVER-STOCKHOLM

HELP:
  spellings: [HELP, MAN]
  arguments: 1
  flags: []
  validator: _validate_help
  description: >
    Lend a hand to players who lost their faith in ATC-NG.

      The command ``/HELP`` provides help on game and aeroplane commands (the
      name of the command must be passed as an argument). If issued without
      arguments, ``/HELP`` display a general help message.
  examples: |

    >>> /HELP LAND
    >>> /MAN MAN
