   contain the root `toctree` directive.

The ATC-NG manual
=================
ATC-NG stands for ***Air Traffic Controller - Next Generation*** and it is a
game inspired by the classic text-only *atc* game from the early eightees.

Currently the game is in **alpha state**: some of the final functionality is
already implemented, but not enough to play the game completely.

**BONUS INFO**: an alternative explanation for the *NG* part of the game is
*"for *Nix Geeks"*. This is a reference to the fact the game only offers a
commandline interface for playing (this is by design and is very unlikely to
change in the future).
