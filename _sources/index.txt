The ATC-NG game
===============
ATC-NG stands for **Air Traffic Controller - Next Generation** [*]_ and it is
a game inspired by the classic text-only *atc* game from the early 80's.
Currently the game is in **alpha state** (currently version |version|): almost
all of the planned functionality for version 1.0 has been implemented and the
game is already playable (the missing bits are about multiple scenarios, scoring
sytem and plugins).

ATC-NG is released under the **GNU General Public License license v3.0** (GPL
v3.0). The full text of the license is available here_).

.. [*] An alternative explanation for the *NG* part of the game is "for
       :term:`\*nix` geeks". This is a reference to the fact the game only
       offers a commandline interface for playing (this is by design and is
       unlikely to change in the future).
