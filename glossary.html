<dt id="term-nix">*nix</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The term <em>unix-like</em> (sometimes shortened to *nix to circumvent trademark
issues) is widely used to describe operating systems that share many of
the characteristics of the original UNIX, which was written in 1969 by Ken
Thompson at Bell Labs. GNU/Linux and BSD are amongst the unix-like family
of operating systems.</p>
<p class="last">Traditionally, users of *nix systems are very versed in the shell
environment, a command line interface operated from keyboard only, hence
the auxiliary origin of the ATC-NG game, which operates purely through
keyboard input.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-airway">Airway</dt>
<dd>Airways are corridors of controlled airspace with a defined lower and
upper base. In ATC-NG airways start/finish at the edge of the aerospace
generating the so called <a class="reference internal" href="#term-gate"><em class="xref std std-term">gates</em></a>. All aeroplanes that are not
on ground must enter and exit the aerospace from them.</dd>
<dt id="term-call-sign">Call sign</dt>
<dd><p class="first">In broadcasting and radio communications, a call sign is a unique
designation for a transmitting station.</p>
<p class="last">in ATC-NG call signs are used for radio (console) communication. For
example British Airways flight 1234 will identify itself as &#8220;Speedbird
1234&#8221;.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-flight-level">Flight level</dt>
<dd><p class="first">In ATC-NG, a flight level is the standard nominal altitude of an aircraft
above the sea level, expressed in hundreds of metres. For example FL 05
means &#8220;500 metres asl&#8221;.</p>
<p class="last">Flight levels are the parameter for the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ALTITUDE</span></tt> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-flight-progress-strips">Flight progress strips</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A flight progress strip is a small strip of paper used to track a flight
in air traffic control (ATC). The strip is placed with other strips in
a &#8216;strip board&#8217; which is then used as a representation of all flights in
a particular sector of airspace or on an airport.</p>
<p class="last">ATC-NG provides <a class="reference internal" href="play/flight-strips.html"><em>virtual strips</em></a> on the left hand
side of the game interface, that can be sorted using <a class="reference internal" href="play/game-commands.html#gcommands-sort"><em>the /SORT game
command</em></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-gate">Gate</dt>
<dd>Gates in ATC-NG are the entry/exit points for the aircraft. An
explanation of how to instruct an aeroplane to use a exit through a gate
is available <a class="reference internal" href="play/leaving-aerospace.html"><em>here</em></a></dd>
<dt id="term-globbing">Globbing</dt>
<dd><p class="first">In computer programming, the verb <em>glob</em> or <em>globbing</em> is used to refer
to an instance of pattern matching behaviour. The noun &#8220;glob&#8221; is used to
refer to a particular pattern.</p>
<p class="last">ATC-NG uses globbing for listing the available scenarios on the system.
See <a class="reference internal" href="play/game-commands.html#gcommands-list"><em>the /LIST game command</em></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-iata">IATA</dt>
<dd><p class="first">IATA stands for <em>International Air Transport Association</em>. IATA&#8217;s mission
is to represent, lead, and serve the airline industry. IATA represents
some 230 airlines comprising 93% of scheduled international air traffic.</p>
<p class="last">ATC-NG uses the IATA airport designators, for example <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ARN</span></tt> for the
Stockholm Arlanda airport and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FRA</span></tt> for the Frankfurt Main one.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-icao">ICAO</dt>
<dd><p class="first">ICAO stands for <em>International Civil Aviation Organization</em>. ICAO is a
specialized agency of the United Nations. It codifies the principles and
techniques of international air navigation and fosters the planning and
development of international air transport to ensure safe and orderly
growth.</p>
<p class="last">ATC-NG uses the ICAO airline designators, for example <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SAS</span></tt> for
Scandinavian Airlines or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DLH</span></tt> for Lufthansa.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-ils">ILS</dt>
<dd><p class="first">ILS stands for <em>Instrument Landing System</em>. ILS is a system that provides
precision guidance to an aircraft approaching and landing on a runway,
using a combination of radio signals and, in many cases, high-intensity
lighting arrays to enable a safe landing.</p>
<p class="last">ATC-NG simulates the presence of ILS at each runways of each airport on
in the scenario. The AI pilots use the simulated ILS to touch down
autonomously when instructed to land.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-markup-language">Markup language</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A mark-up language is a modern system for annotating a text in a way that
is syntactically distinguishable from that text. The idea and terminology
evolved from the &#8220;marking up&#8221; of manuscripts. Markup is typically omitted
from the version of the text which is displayed for end-user consumption.</p>
<p class="last">ATC-NG uses two markup languages internally: <a class="reference internal" href="#term-restructuredtext"><em class="xref std std-term">reStructuredText</em></a> for
its documentation and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-yaml"><em class="xref std std-term">YAML</em></a> for its entities, although it should be
mentioned that the latter is not a markup in the strict sense of the word.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-restructuredtext">reStructuredText</dt>
<dd>reStructuredText is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get
plain text markup syntax and parser system. reStructuredText is a revision
and reinterpretation of the StructuredText and Setext lightweight markup
systems. More info on the format are available on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText website</a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-runway">Runway</dt>
<dd><p class="first">According to ICAO a runway is a <em>&#8220;defined rectangular area on a land
aerodrome prepared for the landing and take-off of aircraft.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Runways are named by a number between 01 and 36, which is generally one
tenth of the magnetic azimuth of the runway&#8217;s heading: a runway numbered
09 points east (90°), runway 18 is south (180°), runway 27 points west
(270°) and runway 36 points to the north (360° rather than 0°). If there
is more than one runway pointing in the same direction (parallel runways),
each runway is identified by appending Left (L), Centre (C) and Right (R)
to the number.</p>
<p class="last">ATC-NG models its airport on real ones, and therefore the size and naming
of the runways is the real one. ATC-NG - though - doesn&#8217;t simulate Earth&#8217;s
magnetic field, and thus the orientation of runways is relative to the
geographical north.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-sprite">Sprite</dt>
<dd>In computer graphics, a sprite is a two-dimensional image or animation
that is integrated into a larger scene. ATC-NG uses sprites for all its
moveable elements (aeroplane icons, flying strips, etc...).</dd>
<dt id="term-tcas">TCAS</dt>
<dd><p class="first">TCAS stands for <em>Traffic Collision Avoidance System</em>. TCAS is an aircraft
collision avoidance system designed to reduce the incidence of mid-air
collisions between aircraft. It monitors the airspace around an aircraft
for other aircraft equipped with a corresponding active transponder,
independent of air traffic control, and warns pilots of the presence of
other transponder-equipped aircraft which may present a threat of mid-air
collision.</p>
<p class="last">ATC-NG simulates the presence of a TCAS on each aircraft in the game
in the scenario. Whenever the player fails to maintain separation between
two or more aeroplanes, the TCAS will instruct the AI pilots to steer away
from each other.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-yaml">YAML</dt>
<dd>YAML is a human-readable data serialization format (that is: a format for
displaying computer-readable data which is nice to the eye of humans).
YAML is a recursive acronym for &#8220;YAML Ain&#8217;t Markup Language&#8221;. Early in its
development, YAML was said to mean &#8220;Yet Another Markup Language&#8221;, but was
retronymed to distinguish its purpose as data-oriented, rather than
document markup. More info on the format are available on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://yaml.org/">YAML website</a>.</dd>
