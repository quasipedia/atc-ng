ATC-NG [Air Traffic Controller - Next Generation]
=================================================

Description
-----------
If you are old enough and liked playing videogames you probably remember the
text-only ATC game now distributed in the "bsdgames" package of several
*nix distributions.

This project aims to occupy the same "market spot": easy gameplay for the
person that has a few minutes to ehm... dedicate to non-strictly productive
activities.

What is similar to the original game:
 - Keyboard only interface
 - Game logic
 - Game elements (planes, aeroports, gates and beacons)

What is "next generation":
 - Graphical environment
 - Basic physics modelling of plane behaviour
 - Aeroport runways
 - Flight strips

For the moment the game aims to be... a game. When version 1.0 will be out I
might consider increasing realism, bringing it conceptually closer to a
simulation.
