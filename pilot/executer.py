        This is a "subroutine" of ``execute`` which is also called by some of
        the procedures. This is such that is possible to process commands
        without triggering score events and setting flags (as it happens with
        ``execute()``).

        This method will silently pass if the command name has not been
        recognised. This is to allow the method to process set of commands that
        also contains *procedures* (such LAND, TAKEOFF, etc...).
