ATC-NG [Air Traffic Controller - Next Generation]
=================================================
**Copyright (C) 2011 Mac Ryan**


Description
-----------
If you are old enough and liked playing videogames you probably remember the
text-only ATC game now distributed in the "bsdgames" package of several
\*nix distributions.

This game is a modern (graphical) reimplementation of it that deliberately
retains some of the clumsiness of the original one.

What is similar to the original game:
 - Keyboard only interface
 - Game logic
 - Game elements (planes, airports, gates and beacons)

What is "next generation":
 - Graphical environment
 - Basic physics modelling of plane behaviour
 - airport runways
 - Flight strips

For the moment the game aims to be... a game. When version 1.0 will be out I
might consider increasing realism, bringing it conceptually closer to a
simulation.


Project status
--------------
Af of 13 Sep 2011 The project is in **alpha**: the game interface is close to
what it will look in the first stable release, and all in-game entities have
been implemented. However **the overall "feel" of the game is still quite
different** from the final one, as both the scenarios and the game modes are
in their early phases.


Packaging
---------
An ubuntu (debian) package of the game is maintained (you can download it from
github__ itself, look for the ``Downloads`` button on the upper right of the
screen)
